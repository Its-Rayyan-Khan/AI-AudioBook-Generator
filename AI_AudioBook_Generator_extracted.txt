AudioBook Generator 

1. Introduction / Objective 

AudioBook Generator is a web application that allows users to upload one or more text 
documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and automatically converts them into high-quality 
audiobooks. The application leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to rewrite extracted 
text in an engaging, listener-friendly “audiobook style” before using open-source Text-to-
Speech (TTS) technology to produce downloadable audio files. This project enhances 
accessibility, productivity, and the enjoyment of written content. 

2. Methodology / Workflow 

1.  User Uploads Documents 

o  Users select and upload one or more documents through an interactive 

Streamlit web interface. 

2.  Text Extraction 

o  The backend parses uploaded files and extracts text content: 

▪  PDF: PyPDF2 or pdfplumber 
▪  DOCX: python-docx 
▪  TXT: Native file reading 

3.  LLM-Based Text Enrichment 

o  Extracted text is processed by a Large Language Model (e.g., OpenAI API, 

Gemini API, or open-source LLM) to rewrite the text for better narration and 
listener experience. 

o  Example LLM prompts: “Rewrite this text for an engaging audiobook 

narration.” 
4.  Text-to-Speech Conversion 

o  The enriched text is fed into an open-source TTS library (such as pyttsx3, 

Coqui TTS, or Tortoise TTS), producing a high-quality .mp3 or .wav audio 
file. 

5.  Audio Download 

o  The generated audio file is presented for immediate download within the 

Streamlit UI. 

3. Modules 

•  Document Upload Module: Handles file uploads via Streamlit. 
•  Text Extraction Module: Extracts raw text from PDFs, DOCX, and TXT files. 
•  LLM Enrichment Module: Calls the LLM to rewrite and enhance extracted text. 
•  Text-to-Speech Module: Converts enriched text into audio using a TTS library. 
•  Audio Delivery Module: Provides the final audio file to the user for download. 

 
 
4. Week-wise Module Implementation and High-Level 
Requirements 

Weeks 1–2: 

•  Set up environment and install dependencies. 
• 

Implement file upload and multi-format text extraction. 

Weeks 3–4: 

Integrate LLM for audiobook-style text rewriting. 

• 
•  Build API connection between Streamlit and backend LLM processing. 

Weeks 5–6: 

Integrate and test open-source TTS conversion. 

• 
•  Ensure support for different voice options and error handling. 

Weeks 7–8: 

•  Finalize UI/UX in Streamlit. 
•  Conduct thorough testing, optimize performance, and complete documentation. 

5. Evaluation Criteria 

•  Milestone 1 (Week 2): 

File upload and accurate text extraction operational. 

•  Milestone 2 (Week 4): 

LLM-based text rewriting working and demonstrably improving narration. 

•  Milestone 3 (Week 6): 

Audio file generation (from rewritten text) stable and high-quality. 

•  Milestone 4 (Week 8): 

Full application workflow—document upload to audio download—operational, user-
friendly, and documented.
